<h2>Interest in Web Development</h2>
    <p>
       My interest in Web Development comes from genuine curiosity of how web pages are structured, designed, and create. Due to my curiousity, I became more proactive on how it all work. The complexity and intricate design of the HTML and css used in a single Google webpage was astonishing. I also think it would be useful having the knowledge of creating a webpage.
